# What is Migration Aid?<a name="whatis"></a> 

Migration Aid was originally established to help asylum-seekers arriving to Hungary reach their assigned refugee camps as soon as possible. Most of them went through Budapest and had no information how to get to the camps, many had no food, water and were in bad health conditions. 
Since 15 September 2015, asylum-seekers no longer cross Budapest. They enter Hungary from the Croatian border and exit through the Austrian border. They are hungry and thirsty and often have to wait several hours in one train station without supplies. There are twice as many asylum-seekers by the border areas than they were in peek periods in the Tranzit Zones of Budapest in August. Our volunteers provide them with some food and drinks, hygiene proucts, warm clothes and medical aid when necessary collaborating with other organisations.

If you want to join the initiative, there are many ways you can help! Join our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/migrationaidhungary) for regularly updated information.

If you would like to donate a larger quantity of goods or services, please contact us via adomany@migrationaid.net to discuss the details. Thank you!

# **Volunteering**<a name="volunteering"></a>

We need volunteers who are able to come to the border areas (currently for example Zákány and Hegyeshalom), preferably for 2-3 day periods to help distribute donations. Please get in touch with our operative coordinator at operation@migrationaid.net to apply. 
We kindly ask everyone NOT to go the border by themselves, as coordination and the reasonable management of resources (both human and material) are essential. Get in touch with out operative coordinator in every case!

If you can only help in Budapest, we **need help at our donation center** at Verseny utca, to receive and select the donations and put together personal packages. If you are able to help, please come to one of our storage facilities, any days of the week. Watch for opening times!

### **Important advice for volunteers**

- It is recommended to use plastic gloves when giving out food or treating sick refugees for your own safety
- It is NOT recommended to transport refugees in your own vehicle even with valid, but especially with expired papers because it can be considered human trafficking
- It is NOT recommended to lend your phone to refugees to make calls or send sms home, because you cannot be sure who they are messaging and it might be considered as crime
- Do not interfere with the work of the police. We are there to help each other and collaborate peacefully.
- Before taking photos or videos of the refugees, please ask their permission and do not publish their full name with their photos on any platform for their safety and the safety of their families staying in their home country
- It is not recommended to share your personal details, address on Facebook, neither the fact that you might take a refugee home to offer them showering and sleeping facilities
- If possible, please do not show pity. Smile and be direct while emphatic!


# InfoAid App <a name="infoaid"></a>

The InfoAid application aims to provide refugees arriving in Hungary with quick and reliable information in their native language.

## What is the InfoAid app?

InfoAid is a small and simple application with low data usage, running on smartphones (currently only on Android, iOS in progress). After installation, current and important information checked by [Migration Aid](http://bit.ly/migaidhu) activists are displayed as messages, in the language selected by the user.
![InfoAid app]({{site.urlimg}}/infoaid_app.png)

InfoAid provides users with information in the following fields:

- what rules apply to them
- where they can receive care, what is going on in transport
- that it is safe to drink running water in Hungary
- where and how they should buy train tickets
- where they can receive medical care
- how they should collect the waste they generate
- where, when and why they have to register and what exactly it involves.

Information is currently available in English, Arabic, Urdu and Farsi, and can be narrowed down to some geographic regions in Hungary. Further languages (Pashto) will be added and volunteer translators, working from English to these languages [are also welcome](http://bit.ly/1KdUVrn).

## How can asylum seekers install the application?

The app is available from Google Play, currently for Android 3.0 and above. The app for iOS is being developed Naturally, an internet (WiFi) or data connection is required for the installation.

### Installation with QR code

It is easiest to install the app if you scan the code below with a QR code reader (there is such an app on almost every smartphone): 

![InfoAid app]({{site.urlimg}}/infoaid_app_QRcode.png)

### Install from Google Play

If you don’t have a QR code reader, open the Google Play application on your phone and search for InfoAid. You need the app with Migration Aid’s green logo. [Direct link](http://bit.ly/infoaid)

## Use

After installation, select the language you wish to use and the locations you wish to follow.  Once it’s done, Migration Aid notifications are displayed automatically in the InfoAid app.
