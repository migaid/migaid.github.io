# What is Migration Aid? 

When entering Hungary at the southern borders, they are registered as asylum seekers and sent to one of the Hungarian refugee camps. They need to get there on their own and within 48 hours. Without speaking Hungarian and receiving detailed instructions on how to get there, they have difficulties finding their way. Most of them have come from Afghanistan, Syria, Iran, several African or Balkan countries with their family and children and have travelled a long way without enough money, food and hygienic conditions, so they are not in the best condition.

**The Migration Aid volunteers decided to help them find which trains or buses take them to their destination and give them food, drinks, personal hygiene products and a couple of good words while they are transiting at train stations.**

If you want to join the initiative, there are many ways you can help! Join our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/migrationaidhungary) for regularly updated information.

**Come to the main train stations of Budapest** where you can find our volunteers (usually wearing a pin with the Migration Aid logo) and join them giving food, drinks and information to arriving refugees. Even if you only have an hour, it would be very helpful, especially if you speak any languages that the refugees might speak!

# How can I help?

**You can make donations, or you can volunteer.**

# Donations

{% include alert warning='THE CENTRAL STORAGE AND KELETI TRANZIT AREA ARE NOW OPEN FOR DONATIONS'%}

{% include alert warning='ATTENTION! THE RECEPTION OF DONATIONS IS TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED NYUGATI AND DELI TRANZIT ZONES! PLEASE, DO NOT BRING/SEND DONATIONS TO THESE LOCATIONS UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE! WE WILL REOPEN OUR STORAGES VERY SOON!' %} 

We are incredibly moved by the generous amount of donations we have received recently from you for the asylum seekers. However, we received so much that our storage rooms are already full, and at the same time we are aware of a large amount of online orders that will arrive in the next few days. We are trying our best to sort and distribute the goods that we received from you among the asylum seekers in need. At the same time, we would like to ask you to NOT TO BRING ANYTHING Deli or Nyugati Tranzit Areas until further notice, when our storage will have been reduced. We will be able to supply the Tranzit Areas from the central storage for the next couple of days. 

Once we have arranged our storages, we will inform you here on our Facebook page and then you can bring more donations. Until then, we will be eternally grateful for your patience! Thank you! Those who have already dispacthed an online order or shipment to us, do not worry! 

We will accept each order that arrives. If you want to send us something now, please schedule the delivery later than 15 September to Verseny street, or wait until further notice.

## What to donate? 

Since are storage capacity is very limited, we cannot save unused donations for later. Therefore we try only to collect things that are needed in the short term. We post a fresh list of collected donations daily on our [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/migrationaidhungary). Please if you can, donate items from that list. 

{% include alert text='Please check or  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/migrationaidhungary"><b>facebook-page</b></a>  regularly, where we post a donation list every day!' %}


### Donating in person

You can hand over your donation to either of the storages in the Tranzit Areas or at our Verseny street storage (you can find the addresses below). In the tranzit areas we have especially small storage, pls only bring items that are listed as needed. See the daily list at our on our [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/migrationaidhungary).

If you live close to a tranzit area, you can join the facebooks groups coordinating the work in that tranzit for more up to date information about what is needed (these groups are in Hungarian though): [Migration Aid Keleti](https://www.facebook.com/groups/835984696454826/), [Migration Aid Nyugati](https://www.facebook.com/groups/490046001145489/), [Migration Aid Déli](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1612866438993255/) 

### Donating fresh food and ingredients

We collect fresh (perishable) food and ingredients for sandwiches both at the tranzit areas and at the central storage at Verseny street. Again please check our  [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/migrationaidhungary) for details. 

### Donating canned food, clothing, household items etc.
We collect these in the Transits and in Verseny street. The list of needed items changes daily, pls see our  [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/migrationaidhungary) for details.


**Currently we dont collect clothes!**

### **Helping from abroad**

#### Donating online shopping 

if you live far away and cannot donate in person, you can place an online order and delivery at Tesco or GRoby, pay it online and have it shipped to our donation center at Verseny street (you can find the address below).

Because these orders can take several days to complete, we do not expect you to comly with our daily list. Therefore we have an "online order shopping list" of things that are always needed:

- blankets, sleeping bags, yoga mats
- raincoats
- prepacked small snaks: cereal bars, waffels, cookies, sweets
- tents

{% include alert warning='PLEASE PUT HOME DELIVERY DONATIONS ON HOLD UNTIL SEPTEMBER 15!' %}

Suddenly we received many donations and we have reached the limit of our storage facility. Because of that, we would like to ask you to put your online shopping/home delivery donations on hold for 1-2 weeks, until we can empty the storages. It would also be best to consult the actual shopping lists later. Thank you for your understanding! 

##### Donating bigger quantitites

If you want to donate in bigger quantities (eg you had a fundraiser or you are donating for a company) please conatct us beforehand a adomany@migrationaid.net.

#### Funding medical aid
Migration Aid cannot accept money directly. However, if you would like to give money, you can donate to **Mikszáth Pharmacy’s bank account (Egészségért Foundation)**. The pharmacy has been supporting our work with pharmaceuticals for a while now. Though refugees are entitled for free basic health care services, they need to pay for medicines, and first aid products. 

When you donate, please send an e-mail to the adomany@migrationaid.net address with the amount you have given, so we can also keep track of the donations.

Address and opening hours:

      Verseny street 10

At the moment we DO NOT COLLECT ANY TYPE OF CLOTHES. Please follow our Facebook page where we post the actual needs daily and we will communicate when we collect clothes again. Thank you!
Please only bring those items to our storage room which are listed above. There is a reason why the list is short and that is your immense generosity, since we received a tremendous amount of donations in the past few days and many of you informed us about online orders to be shipped in the next two weeks but our storage facilities are limited. Therefore, we will only collect clothes, toys, hygiene items again, once the accumulated storages are reduced. We will update the donation list on Facebook every morning 7 am CET with the daily needs.

# **Volunteering**
In the meanwhile, we really **need more volunteers at the train stations** to give information and directions to the immigrants, and at our storage locations too. 

Much of the work is coordinated through facebook gropus. If you want to volunteer, it's good to join this group: [MIGRATION AID](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1602563053360018/). The top post will contain a guide about how to sign up (in English too). 

You can also just look for our volunteers at the train stations of Budapest (Nyugati, Déli, Keleti) and offer your help directly.

We **need help at our donation center** at Verseny utca, to receive and select the donations and put together personal packages. If you are able to help, please come to one of our storage facilities, any days of the week. Watch for opening times!

**We also need the help of interpreters and translators**, especially in the following languages: Arabic, Urdu, Farsi, Pastu, Turkish, French, English, Albanian. Unfortunately, many refugees are in poor health conditions, we often **need medical help, volunteer doctors and nurses** are more than welcome to join our initiative! If you can help with interpretation or medical aid, please come to any train station in Budapest and offer your assistance to the volunteers there or let us know your contact details and availability also through migrationaidhungary@gmail.com


### **Important advice for volunteers**

- It is recommended to use plastic gloves when giving out food or treating sick refugees for your own safety
- It is NOT recommended to transport refugees in your own vehicle even with valid, but especially with expired papers because it can be considered human trafficking
- It is NOT recommended to lend your phone to refugees to make calls or send sms home, because you cannot be sure who they are messaging and it might be considered as crime
- Do not interfere with the work of the police. We are there to help each other and collaborate peacefully.
- Before taking photos or videos of the refugees, please ask their permission and do not publish their full name with their photos on any platform for their safety and the safety of their families staying in their home country
- It is not recommended to share your personal details, address on Facebook, neither the fact that you might take a refugee home to offer them showering and sleeping facilities
- If possible, please do not show pity. Smile and be direct while emphatic!
