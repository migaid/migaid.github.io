More than 4 months have passed since the community of Migration Aid started to help those asylum-seekers who travelled through Hungary. Great many people decided to help seeing that their donations can help save lives. There was an incredible amount of people who supported the cause with their time and energy. In a few months maybe one of the biggest network of volunteers formed in the history of Hungary. 

Since the middle of October, asylum-seekers can no longer use Hungary as a transit country, but the Hungarian citizens still whole-heartedly continue helping the travelling asylum-seekers outside of Hungary’s borders by providing food, clothing and other donations. In order to ensure continuous supply integrating and jointly coordinating the donors and volunteers across borders becomes more and more important. 

Therefore, the coordinators of Migration Aid decided to establish a supporting organization besides the Hungarian Migration Aid Association under the name Migration Aid International (MAI) to coordinate the international cooperation. The Migration Aid International was registered in the United Kingdom as a charity a few days ago.
Migration Aid International will coordinate its activities through projects with transparent budget lines and regularly publishing their financial reports on its official website.

We envision the Hungarian Migration Aid Association as an organization dedicated to field work, aftercare and providing legal, integrational and social help to asylum-seekers and other deprived groups as needs arise, as well as carrying out social and public activities related to refugees, collecting donations and ensuring the conditions to the functioning of the Facebook group. 

The Migration Aid International is represented by the board of directors, namely the following 6 people: 
dr. Katalin Dani (General Director)
Gabriella Dávidáné Albert (General Director)
Katalin Fritz (Director of Finances)
Dalma Sári (General Director)
András Siewert (Director of Operations)
Zsuzsanna Zsohár (Director of Migration Management)

Seat: 5 High Street, Westbury on Trym, Bristol BS9 3BY, United Kingdom
